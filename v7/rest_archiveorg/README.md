This plugin adds a reStructuredText directive to embed a player for video and
audio files from archive.org.

### Usage

Basic usage:

    .. archiveorg:: <identifier>

This generates an IFRAME (with the CSS class `archiveorg-player`) in the HTML
output, which loads the player from archive.org. The player uses JavaScript, so
the user must allow JavaScript for `https://archive.org`. The identifier is the
name of the media item or collection, e.g. when you view an item on the
archive.org webpage, it is the part of its URL that comes after
`https://archive.org/details/`.

To set the width and height of the generated IFRAME (default is 640x45 pixels):

    .. archiveorg:: <identifier>
       :height: 480
       :width: 640

To enable autoplay media on pageload:

    .. archiveorg:: <identifier>
        :autoplay:

To show a playlist in the player (sets default IFRAME height to 580 pixels):

    .. archiveorg:: <identifier>
        :playlist:

A playlist is always shown when the identifier refers to a playlist, rather
than to a single media file. In this case, if you don't specify the `playlist`
option explicitly, you should set the `height` option manually to something
around 580.

To set the playlist height:

    .. archiveorg:: <identifier>
        :list_height: 150

To set a "click to play" image:

    .. archiveorg:: <identifier>
        :poster: http://example.com/cover.png

To add a paragraph element after the IFRAME with direct download links for the
media item in MP3 and Ogg Vorbis format:

    .. archiveorg: <identifier>
        :download: MediaFileBasename
        :download_label: Download media:

You can find out the basename of the media file by inspecting the links in the
"Download Options" section of the detail page of the media item on the
archive.org website.

The paragraph with the download links will have the CSS class
`archiveorg-download-links` and the label will have the class
`archiveorg-download-label`, allowing you to style the links in your theme or
`custom.css`.
