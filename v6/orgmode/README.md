This plugin implements an Emacs Org-mode based compiler for Nikola.

## Setup

If your emacs does not ship with org-mode (>=8.x), you will have to edit the
`init.el` file supplied with this plugin, and load a newer version of org-mode.

You will also need to add the orgmode compiler to your list of compilers, and
modify your POSTS & PAGES variables.  (See the sample conf file provided.)

### Syntax highlighting with pygments

By default, the plugin uses `pygments` for syntax highlighting. You can disable
this by setting `nikola-use-pygments` to `nil` in `init.el` or `conf.el` (see
Customization section below).

To get proper syntax highlighting, you will need to add custom CSS to your
theme. You can generate this CSS using the `pygmentize` command as follows:

    pygmentize -S <PYGMENTS_STYLE> -a .highlight -f html >> custom.css

and make sure that `custom.css` is included in your site by your
theme. The various available style options for `<PYGMENTS_STYLE>` can be found
using the command `pygmentize -L style`.

## Customization

You can add any customization variables that you wish to add, to modify the
output generated by org-mode to `conf.el` inside the plugin directory.  This
lets you have custom configuration, that doesn't get wiped out each time the
plugin is updated.
