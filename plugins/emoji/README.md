Plugin to embed emojis in restructuredText.

Usage::

    I give this plugin a :emoji:`+1`

And yes, I know the syntax is annoying but :+1: is invalid restructuredText syntax.

An alternative is to just use emojify.js in your templates.

The emojis are **not** shipped with this plugin, they are provided by http://tortue.me
