This plugin implements an Emacs Org-mode based compiler for Nikola.

## Setup

To start using this plugin, you will need to edit the `init.el` file
supplied with this plugin, and load org-mode (>=8.x).  You can add any
customization variables that you wish to add, to modify the output generated
by org-mode.

You will also need to add the orgmode compiler to your list of compilers, and
modify your POSTS & PAGES variables.  (See the sample conf file provided.)
