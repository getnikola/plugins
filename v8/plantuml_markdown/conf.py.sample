#
# IMPORTANT
#
# You also need to configure the "plantuml" plugin.
#
# When editing pages it will help to set "PLANTUML_CONTINUE_AFTER_FAILURE=True"
# so PlantUML errors will be shown in the output HTML.
#

#
# PLANTUML_MARKDOWN_OPTIONS (list of strings) - options used when rendering for markdown files,
# see https://plantuml.com/command-line
#
# Note this is independent of PLANTUML_FILE_OPTIONS in the "plantuml" plugin.
# If you want them to be the same then do "PLANTUML_FILE_OPTIONS = PLANTUML_MARKDOWN_OPTIONS = [ ... ]"
#
# Examples
# --------
# Use a common style file for all diagrams:
#   [ '-Imy_plantuml_style.iuml' ]
#
# Specify the style in conf.py
#   [ '-chide footbox', '-SShadowing=false' ]
#
PLANTUML_MARKDOWN_OPTIONS = []
