This is a simple plugin you can use as a basis for your own. It does nothing interesting:

* It creates a task for Nikola
* The task prints a notice saying "Hello World"
* The task is always considered out of date, so it always runs, unless you set `BYE_WORLD=True` in conf.py

This copy is mildly more interesting, as the plugins site considers it v8-only. (It isn’t.)
